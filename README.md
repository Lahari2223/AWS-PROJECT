# Building Real-Time AWS Log Analytics Solution
Here in this project I have used to the aws services(AWS KINESIS ,AWS LAMBDA ,AWS S3) to analyze the how the real time data streaming happens.
In this project I have a taken a text file and uploaded it in s3 bucket.
When we made any changes then it will be reflected in the cloud watch logs.
